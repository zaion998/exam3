                <h3>The Kumsusan Palace of the Sun</h3>
                <p>The Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, formerly the Kumsusan Memorial Palace and also known as the Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il Mausoleum, is a building in Pyongyang's northeast corner that serves as the mausoleum for North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, and his son, Kim Jong-il, who were both posthumously designated as Eternal President and Eternal General Secretary. The Kumsusan Assembly Hall, which functioned as Kim Il-official sung's home, was erected in 1976. Kim Jong-il had the structure refurbished and turned into his father's tomb after the older Kim died in 1994. It is estimated to have cost at least $100 million. According to other accounts, the sum might be as high as $900 million. Kim Jong-il's remains are currently on display in a chamber next to his father's and are arranged in a same manner.</p>

                <h3>Kim II Sung Square</h3>
                <p>North Korea's main public plaza, Kim II Sung Square, is located in the heart of Pyongyang, the capital. Kim Il Sung Square is most known for holding North Korea's military parades, which are often covered by international and domestic media. Mass dances, rallies, and new year's festivities featuring live performances by the Moranbong band, ice sculptures, and fireworks are all hosted on the square during special occasions. It was finished in August 1954, named after the country's founding leader and everlasting President Kim Il Sung, as the country sought to rebuild itself after being substantially decimated by the Korean War. Kim Il Sung Square, which is paved with granite titles, can house up to 100,000 people. This is how troops and entertainers maintain flawless order during military parades attended by tens of thousands of people.</p>

                <h3>Myohyang</h3>
                <p>Mt. Myohyang is one of North Korea's five most famous mountains, located in the country's hilly northwestern region. Locals refer to it as the "mystery scented mountain." It is well-known for the breathtaking views from its top, which stands at 1909 meters. Several hiking paths surrounding the mountain are surrounded by unspoiled flower fields, adding to the peak's scenic appeal. According to history, this mountain was originally home to King Tangun, the fabled progenitor of the Korean people. Because it is only a day journey from Pyongyang, this mountain has become a popular tourist attraction in the DPRK.</p>

                <h3>Mansu Hill Grand Monument</h3>
                <p>In April 1972, the monument was erected to commemorate Kim Il Sung's 60th birthday. Only Kim Il-sung was featured on the monument at the time. Following Kim Jong-death il's in 2011, a similar monument of him was constructed on the north side of Kim Il-sung. The statue was originally clad in gold leaf, but was eventually changed to bronze. Simultaneously, Kim Il-monument sung's was changed to show him at a later age, smiling. The original Mao outfit worn by Kim Il-sung was likewise replaced with a Western-style suit. Kim Jong-monument il's originally had a long coat, but it was quickly replaced with his distinctive parka. Two memorials, one on either side of the statues, lead out from the structure and feature sculptures representing various soldiers, laborers, and farmers engaged in anti-Japanese revolutionary battle and socialist revolution.</p>

                <h3>Juche Tower</h3>
                <p>The Juche Tower was built on the occasion of the 70th birthday of President Kim Il-Sung, by the River Taedong in 1982 (Juche 71). The tower has a 20-metre-long torch which can be seen glowing throughout the night. The Juche idea is central to North Korea's policies and political framework, stressing the need of self-reliance and self-defense. You can go up the Juche Tower and have a panoramic view of the whole capital city. It is also possible to sit and relax by the steps leading to the tower seeing people get along with their daily lives. Right across from the river the portraits of the Leaders can be seen in Kim Il Sung Square with the impressive Grand People's Study House in the background. The skyline of Pyongyang had some major changes in 2012 and many of the buildings seen on the right-hand side of the square are new.</p>
